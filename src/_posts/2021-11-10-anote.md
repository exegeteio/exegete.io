Writing notes is a big part of my workflow, and `tmux` has created an opportunity for shortcuts in
note taking.  Specifically, I've created an `anote` command (`~/bin/anote`).  This command takes
input and outputs to a special buffer in `tmux`.  

```sh
$ rg --vimgrep Needle | anote
```

This will add the results of that search to `vim` in a `tmux` buffer.  In face, this was added by
`anote`:

```sh
$ rg --vimgrep -- - cli | anote

How cool is that?

    Designing, building, and maintaining applications for selling insurance
    policies online for a variety of products. This position continually
    offers challenges by offering multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS)
    applications, with thousands of unique tenants. Each tenant could have its
    own template, verbiage, and even functionality. In addition, many tenants
    had specific browser requirements which restricted technology choices
    across the applications. The applications were featured by carriers such as
    Allstate, Geico, and Progressive.

        In my role as Lead Developer, I advance both retail and wholesale
        operations to offer the best possible user experience when purchasing
        insurance online.  I continually strive to keep the company at the
        forefront of technology best practices and processes, while delivering
        the best experience to future and legacy customers.

        Over my tenure, I developed and launched nineteen unique insurance
        products in various languages and frameworks, based on the demands of
        the product.  The applications incorporated all aspects of the
        business, from COVID informational websites to monthly accounting.

        In my role as Systems Administrator, I am responsible for ensuring the
        stability of technology systems within the company.  This includes
        transitioning from an on-premises data-center to a co-located remote
        data-center, and eventually to cloud hosting with Azure and AWS.

        I also implemented a complete architecture migration from AWS EC2
        instances to Kubernetes, cutting the AWS bills by 50%.  This change 
        also improved uptime, resiliency, and release velocity, while
        simplifying the overall architecture.  This architecture also increased
        uptime to 99.99% since deployment.

        This role encompasses not only researching, designing, implementing,
        and testing the systems, but also 24 x 7 x 365 on-call support.
        Additionally, I am responsible for ensuring the design and performance
        of the databases backing the applications and websites.

        In my role as a Project Manager, I helped recover a struggling team of
        designers, developers, and systems administrators, to be reach their
        full potential.  After only a few weeks, the team was hitting deadlines
        and shipping mission critical changes, without resorting to "crunch".

        In light of my success, I was also assigned to reinvigorate other
        struggling teams, helping to successfully align the teams' output with
        the requirements provided from upper management.

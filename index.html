<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  I've enjoyed exploring programming puzzles since I started learning C and C++
  in high school. While learning these low-level languages was exciting, writing
  Bash and Perl to automate my home network really hooked me on programming.
  While writing software for bottled-water delivery, I began writing apps for
  the web, and have never looked back.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of work, I still find myself drawn to development. I try to learn a
  new language or framework every year. The exposure to different approaches has
  helped me immensely in work and personal applications.

<p>
  When not at the computer, I'm a father, motorcyclist, and bicyclist. Living in
  Flagstaff, AZ, there is no-end to outdoor adventures to share with my family.

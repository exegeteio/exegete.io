  <h2>Software</h2>
  <p>
    I've done almost all of my development work on a Mac since OSX came out.  MacOS is, to me, what
    desktop Linux has been trying to be.  Almost everything works without drivers install, or kernel
    re-compiles.  OS / Hardware, however, is as individual as clothing brands.  Find what works for
    you.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>
      All around great application launcher and shortcut tool for MacOS.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>
      The browser I've found to be the most consistently good.  Privacy, memory footprint, speed,
      standards implementations, and syncing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://rectangleapp.com/">Rectangle</a>
      Keyboard-based window-management for MacOS.  Supports thirds of a monitor, which is important
      for my workflow on an ultra-wide monitor.
    </li>
    <li>
      vim
      Old-school, works everywhere (even on remote servers) editor.  Lots of plugins where useful.
      See my dotfiles for more.
    </li>
    <li>
      VS Code
      Graphical editor with support for many languages and frameworks.  Extensions for just about
      everything.
    </li>
    <li>
      Containers / Docker
      Containers are a revelation for Ops.  Having consistent, reproducable, customizable, builds
      to ship to servers is not an easy thing to accomplish, but containers help make it happen.
      Docker was the first major company to profitize containers, for which they get kudos.

  <h2>Physical Space</h2>
  <p>
    Physical space is more and more important to me as I get older and older.  Learn from my
    mistakes, invest in a good workspace as soon as you're able.  Take care of your body, you only
    get one.

  <h2>Computers</h2>
  <p>
    I like the Apple hardware I've had over the years.  From my first Blueberry iBook, to the 16"
    Intel Macbook Pro I use every day.  This is a <em>very</em> personal choice, however.
    Over the years, I've used Linux, Windows, and BSD, for workstations.
  </p>
  <p>
    People often complain about the "Apple Tax".  My rebuttal is:  I have
    yet to find a spec-for-spec comparison (including physical enclosure, touchpad, etc), where a
    Mac came out to be much more expensive.  Yes, you can get a Dell with a flimsy plastic enclosure
    and a 3-generation-old CPU for 75% of the cost of a Mac.  I'll take the whole package.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      16" Intel Macbook Pro (MBP).  Mobile development.  I love sitting in a coffee shop, or go to
      lunch, to work on difficult problems.
      Not going to lie, I tried to get an M1 Max Macbook Pro, but the delays in shipping means I'm
      using this for the foreseeable future.
    </li>
    <li>
      2022 Mac Studio (M1 Max).  When I couldn't get the M1 MBP, got this instead.  Incredibly
      fast in every task I've asked it to perform.  What blew me away most was the performance of
      Docker.  Normally Docker on a Mac is rather slow, but not on the M1.
    </li>
    <li>
      MSI GS66 Stealth.  Thin and light gaming laptop.  My gaming is split between my office, and
      hanging out with the family in the living room.  This laptop accomplishes that task, as well
      as handling streaming duties, for Twitch.
    </li>
  </ul>

<section title="monitors">
  <h2>Monitors</h2>
  <p>
    I picked up an ultra-wide monitor for gaming, and found an boost to my productivity.  I tend to
    work in thirds of a screen now, and find that the layout really works for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I'm not a fan of Alienware's computers, or their business practices (prior to Dell, at
    least), I find their monitors to be as high quality as Dell's business-class monitors.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16824260555">
        Alienware AW3418DW 34" Ultra-wide

      3440 x 1440 @ 120hz.

        Alienware AW2521HF 25"
      </a>
      Nice gaming monitor, in portrait orientation.  I find the 25" compliments most other
      primary-monitor sizes.

      open-back headphones.  Great sound quality, open-back to let your ears breath, and very
      comfortable.  Having a child, good headphones became very important to me a couple years ago.

        In my role as Lead Developer, I advanced both retail and wholesale
        operations to offer the best possible user experience when purchasing
        insurance online.  I continually strove to keep the company at the
        forefront of technology best practices and processes, while delivering
        the best experience to future and legacy customers.

        Over my tenure, I developed and launched nineteen unique insurance
        products in various languages and frameworks, based on the demands of
        the product.  The applications encorporated all aspects of the
        business, from COVID informational websites to monthly accounting.

        In my role as Systems Administrator, I was responsible for ensuring the
        stability of all technology systems within the company.  This included
        transitioning from an on-premesis data-center to a co-lcated remote
        data-center, and eventually to cloud hosting with Azure and AWS.

        I also implemented a complete architecture migration from AWS EC2
        instances to Kubernetes, cutting the AWS spend by 50%.  This change 
        also improved uptime, resiliency, and release velocity, while
        simplifying the overall architecture.  This architecture also increased
        uptime to 99.99% since deployment.

        This role encompassed not only researching, designing, implementing,
        and testing the systems, but also 24 x 7 x 365 on-call support.
        Additionally, I was responsible for ensuring the design and performance
        of the databases backing the applications and websites.

I found a great Youtube channel recently called
[Tech Craft](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT-GpMtIFhX9EMA0Eauevhw).
Tech craft has some interesting views on going iPad only for development and
mobile computing in general.

## Apps for iPad

- [Blink](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blink-shell-mosh-ssh-client/id1156707581) - Terminal emulator. Supports ssh very well, has some native capabilities. Remap caps and tilde to useful things!
- [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807)
  Git client for iPad. Great for cloning repos and quick edits to markdown files.
- [Textastic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor-8/id1049254261) - Text editor on the iPad. Can open repos from Working Copy.

One of the first things I install on a new machine is a Multi-clipboard app.

On MacOS, I use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).  I bind Alfred to <kbd>Command+Space</kbd>,
but the multi-paste is on <kbd>Command+Shift+V</kbd>.  Alfred has baked in support for "snippets",
or pre-saved pasts.  If you write the same thing on every expense report?  Snippet.  Alfred is more
than just a Multi-clipboard.  Alfred also works as an app launcher, a search mechanism, and a light
calculator. I've also created several custom searches for work, such as prefixing my search with `j`
will search Jira.  Clipboard history does require paying for their
[Power Pack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/), which I have no regrets about purchasing.

On Windows, I use [ClipX](https://bluemars.org/clipx/) and the Stickies (scroll down the ClipX page)
plugin.  This gives the same functionality as snippets in Alfred.  I bind ClipX to use
<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+V</kbd>, for opening the menu.

Please do not store passwords in either of these, and be sure to clear your clipboard history before
sharing your screen.

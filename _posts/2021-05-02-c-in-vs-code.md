When VS Code asks to create "missing" files, DO IT! This creates the `.vscode` folder and enabled
OmniSharp and Intellisense to start working. Prior to this being in place, nothing worked. I
struggled with VS Code for a few hours to get OmniSharp working, because I either did not see, or
did not understand this popup.

Finished up required corporate security compliance just now.  I think they sent
a "congratulations" email, but there was a PDF attached to it.  The whole
episode was about "See something, say something".  Was this a sneaky test to
see if I was paying attention?  Certainly seemed like it.

Moral of the story:  If you get a phishing email, **report it** if you can.

Sometimes you need to take a look at all the files in a given folder in
[s3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Downloading them through the web UI is
cumbersome at best.

After signing in with the AWS CLI, you can use the following to copy down files:

```bash
$ aws s3 sync s3://[bucket]/[path] /tmp/[localpath]
```

`/tmp` is just to make sure the files get deleted at logout, you can use whatever path you'd like.

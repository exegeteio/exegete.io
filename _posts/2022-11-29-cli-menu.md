I started making myself simple CLI menus about a year ago, and now I don't know how I lived without
it.  Essentially my `menu` command takes a list of inputs, and allows you to select one, and return
that value.  Seems too simple to be useful, right?  Let's see the real world example:

```sh
$ ls
Dockerfile Rakefile Gemfile Gemfile.lock
$ echo "You selected: $(ls | menu)"
1) Dockerfile
2) Rakefile
3) Gemfile
4) Gemfile.lock
#? 3
You selected: Gemfile
```

Ok, but what good is that?!  Let's say you want to edit a specific file but you don't remember the
name:

```sh
$ vi $(find ./ | grep -i controller | menu)
1) app/controllers/home_controller.rb
2) app/controllers/awesome_controller.rb
#?
```

One last modification:  If only one item is found, just return it.

```sh
$ echo "You selected: $(find ./ | grep -i awesome | menu)"
You selected: app/controllers/awesome_controller.rb
```

Now, I use two flavors of my `menu` command.  If `fzf` (Fuzzy Finder) is installed, it uses that,
and if not it falls back to bash's `select` command.  `fzf` has the advantage of being able to type
partial file names, and it allows multi-select which I leave on by default, so I rather recommend
giving it a chance, even if it's not available on **every** machine.

Here is my `menu` command at the time of writing:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
if [[ -x "$(which fzf)" ]]; then
  exec fzf -0 -1 -m --bind ctrl-a:select-all
else
  in=$(</dev/stdin)
  if [[ -z "$in" ]]; then
    echo "menu - nothing to display"
    exit 1
  fi
  readarray lines <<< $in
  if [[ "${#lines[@]}" == "1" ]]; then
    echo "${lines[0]}"
  else
    IFS=$'\n'
    select sel in ${lines[@]}; do
      echo "$sel"
      exit
    done < /dev/tty
  fi
fi
```

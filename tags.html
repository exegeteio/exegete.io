<p>
  As a part of my personal note-taking, I started writing Jekyll posts and tagging them.  Below are
  the tags.  I consider each of these to be micro-blogs.  Don't expect too much
  content in each.
</p>

{% assign tags = site.tags | sort %}
<ul>
  {% for tag in tags %}
    <li class="site-tag">
      <a href="/tag/{{ tag | first | slugify }}/">
              {{ tag[0] | replace:'-', ' ' }} ({{ tag | last | size }})
      </a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

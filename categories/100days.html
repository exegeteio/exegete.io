title: 100 Days of Code
---

<p>
	100 Days of Code is a challenge I set for myself in 2021 to blog about code
	100 times in the first 100 days of 2021.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Update:</em> Nope, didn't make it.  Some things went down that broke my
	streak.  Now the goal is to do 100 code blogs in all of 2021.
